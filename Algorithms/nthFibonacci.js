//The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 
//0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... 
//The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.


//Make a function that returns a array of the sequence of the nthFibonnaci number
//Ex. nthFibonnaci(5) => [0,1,1,2,3]

//**Hint**: Use Recursion

var nthFibonacci = function (n) {
  // TODO: implement me!
};
