// Bubble sort  works by starting at the first element of an array and
// comparing it to the second element; if the first element is greater than the
// second element, it swaps the two. It then compares the second to the third,
// and the third to the fourth, and so on; in this way, the largest values
// "bubble" to the end of the array. Once it gets to the end of the array, it
// starts over and repeats the process until the array is sorted numerically.

//Time Complexity:

// Extra credit: Optimize your solution so that during any given pass, if no elements are
// swapped we can assume the list is sorted and can exit the function early.
// After this optimization, what is the time complexity of your algorithm?
//
// More Extra Credit: Do you need to consider every element every time you iterate
// through the array?  Again: Has the time complexity of your algorithm changed?
